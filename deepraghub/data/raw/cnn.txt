Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily used for analyzing visual imagery. They are inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.
