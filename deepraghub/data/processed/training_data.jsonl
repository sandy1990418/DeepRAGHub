{"text1": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily used for analyzing visual imagery. They are inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.", "text2": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.", "similarity": 0.8}
